# Comparing Computer Resource Usage Through Interpolating G.E.D.I. LiDAR Waveform Data
In our study we aim to compare the computer resources utilised by cubic and linear splines. We will access and use publicly available data collected by Nasa’s Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation’s (GEDI) LiDAR technology to model waveforms using cubic and linear b-spline interpolation. We will compare the viability and efficiency of these two interpolation methods to determine which is more applicable when working with GEDI data, and when working with datasets similar in size, scope, and variability specifically as it relates to artificial intelligence creation. This study will assist researchers working with GEDI data and data like it to make more informed decisions about creating models and the efficiency of those models as it relates to large scale artificial intelligence deployment.
